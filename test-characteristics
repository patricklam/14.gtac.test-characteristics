Why do we care about test suite characteristics?
A: get better test suites
 - more maintainable
 - more usable (e.g. faster runtime)
 - fewer unjustified failures

Obvious characteristics:
 - size
 - coverage (stmt, class hierarchy)
 - running time

Also:
 - complexity
 - CLONES
 - determinism

 - Resource usage (memory, file/network I/O)
 - Optimization (parallelization of tests)
 - Refactorability (when I was reviewing some results, I realized that one of the reasons that we have clones in the first place is that some of these clones cannot be easily refactored)
